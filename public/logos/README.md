## How to Add Logos

1. Download or obtain the official logos from their respective sources
2. Place them in this directory (`public/logos/`)
3. Ensure they are named exactly as:
   - `wits-logo.png`
   - `openvpn-logo.png`
4. The application will automatically display them in the header

## Fallback Behavior

If logos are not found, the application will gracefully hide the image placeholders and continue to function normally.

## Color Scheme

The application uses Wits University colors:
- **Primary**: Navy Blue (#003366)
- **Secondary**: Gold (#FFD700)
- **Background**: White with gradient overlays

Ensure logos complement these colors for best visual appearance.
